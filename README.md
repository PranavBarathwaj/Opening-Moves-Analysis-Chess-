# Opening-Moves-Analysis-Chess

In this project, we identify the opening moves of chess that are most likely to result in a win for either white or black, based on player ratings. By analyzing a large dataset of chess games played by different skilled players in various timed games without increments for each move, this project will identify patterns and trends in the opening moves played. The objective is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of a win based on the opening moves played, which will help find the most suitable opening moves for a given player based on their skill level

The data resources used for this project is a chess data set containing data for more than 20,000+ games played on Lichess, an online platform for chess.
